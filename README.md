# Assignment-4
**The java file named Assignment4 is the main file in the repository**
*This program scans a csv file and makes a chart showing the genres of different movies and the amount of them per genre, from *largest to smallest.
*There are two classes, a Chart class which holds the code to make the chart and a Info class which parses and sorts the info from *the file.
*The file is sent to 5 methods in the info class to parse the data through the parse and year methods, then counts the data through *the count method and finally orders and cleans up empty or null spaces in the descending order method.
*The info needed is then sent to different mehtods which copy the data and send them to the chart class.
*Using a line graph and Javafx, the genre and counter method is used to create a table showing the data.
*Answer: I would like to show the store owner the amount of each genre that was released in order to help him get a good idea for *his Catalog sizes, as well as which ones are more commonly made, especially when combining it witht the averages found in this *program.
